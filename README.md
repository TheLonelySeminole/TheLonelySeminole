# TheLonelySeminole here...

- Right now I'm just messing around and learning how git works between my peronsal workstation at home and Github
- I've recently gotten interested in arch linux, so I'm using some arch .config files as my first real Github repository
- Currently I'm into Hyprland (just figured out nvidia drivers, check out my .dotfiles/Documents) and Neovim ( go figure )
  - Also generally hacking around with golang, python, a little C. Contemplating digging into Rust a bit.
  - I love the linux cli rust tools like exa, ripgrep, batcat, etc.
- Nothing groundbreaking here, just love nerding out on the current bleeding edge of linux.
